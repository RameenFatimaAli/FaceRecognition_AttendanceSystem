# FaceRecognition_AttendanceSystem
## Overview
Face recognition-based attendance system is a process of recognizing the faces of the students while taking attendance by using face bio-metrics based on highâ€“definition monitor video and other information technology. In our face recognition project, a computer system can find and recognize human faces quickly and precisely in images or videos captured through a webcam/surveillance camera. Here, faces will be recognized using the face recognition algorithm.
